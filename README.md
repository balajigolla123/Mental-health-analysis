Exploring Mental Health Trends Through Datal

I recently completed a data analysis project using a real-world mental health dataset collected during the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.

Using Python, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib, I explored trends in:

Medication and therapy usage

Mental health needs across gender and age

Impact of family history on treatment

17 Service usage changes over time

I visualized this data through:

Histograms

Pie charts

Box plots

Line graphs

Scatter plots

One of my key takeaways: young adults and those with a family history of mental illness were more likely to seek treatment, while disparities in access still exist-especially for marginalized groups.

This project helped me sharpen my data visualization skills and better understand how analytics can support mental health research and policymaking.

Check out a few of the charts below!
